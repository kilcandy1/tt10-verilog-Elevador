## How it works

Explain how your project works
To build the three-story elevator system, we need to take into account that we will use two push buttons, which are the inputs that will allow us to send a signal to the DC motors, which in turn will be connected to an L298N module (H bridge). These two motors

will allow us to move the elevator either up or down. We will also use a 7-segment display to be able to see the floor number we are on. The three-story elevator project would look like this.

## External hardware
2 buttons

DC motors: The direct current motor, also called direct current motor, (DC motor or DC motor) is a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, causing a rotary movement, thanks to the action of a magnetic field.

7-segment display: It is an opto-electronic device that allows numbers from 0 to 9 to be displayed. There are two types of display, common cathode and common anode.
